Finally! I published a new academic blog using Github. This blog is built based on [academicpages.github.io](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). I slightly modiifed the pages by following the guidelines on the academic pages and other references.

During the deployment, I got some failures due to incorrect setup or syntax errors. If you get the same errors, you can debug them by going to the **Action** tab in your github repository. There you will find the deployment logs. 

Actually, I still manage my oldÂ [blog](https://wanprabu.wordpress.com), though it has been a long time since I made any updates there. But then I decided to make another blog with more academic and research content.
