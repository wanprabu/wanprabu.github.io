Hi! I am a PhD fellow student in the Industrial Engineering Department at [UiT The Arctic University of Norway](https://uit.no). Additionally, I am affiliated with [Telkom University - Surabaya Campus](https://surabaya.telkomuniversity.ac.id/) as a lecturer in the undergraduate program of the Industrial Engineering Department. Prior to my academic pursuits, I also gained several years of experience working in the IT industry.
